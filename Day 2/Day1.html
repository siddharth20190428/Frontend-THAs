    <p>Dear Dean,</p>

    <p>
      This is to inform you that Devsnest is organising a 30 Day code camp for
      <br />
      begginers. I have attended this camp past two months and was overwhelmed
      <br />
      by the quality of knowledge. So, I request you to grant me permission so
      <br />
      they can organise this camp for the students of the university.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yours Sincerely <br />
      Siddharth <br />
